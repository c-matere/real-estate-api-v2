# UI/UX Enhancements Blueprint

**Last updated: 2025-05-14**

Here are targeted UI/UX enhancements to layer onto the existing dashboard:

1. Consistent Design System
   - Adopt a component library (e.g. Material, Ant Design) for cohesive styling
   - Define color palette, typography, and spacing scales
   - Enforce consistent button, form, and modal patterns

2. Simplified Navigation
   - Use a clear sidebar with labels and icons for major sections
   - Highlight current section with active state and breadcrumbs
   - Provide a global “Quick Actions” menu for common tasks

3. Visual Unit Status Overview
   - Display units in a grid or floor plan, color-coded by status
   - Allow hover or click to reveal unit details and quick actions

4. Interactive Data Tables
   - Enable inline sorting, filtering, and pagination
   - Offer column visibility toggles and row actions (assign, edit, delete)
   - Support bulk selection and batch operations

5. Real-Time Feedback & Validation
   - Implement inline form validation with contextual error messages
   - Auto-save drafts for long forms (e.g., lease creation)
   - Show loading indicators on buttons and sections to signal progress

6. Guided Wizards for Complex Flows
   - Break multi-step processes (tenant intake, unit assignment) into clear steps
   - Display progress bar and allow back-navigation
   - Persist data between steps to prevent loss

7. Advanced Search & Filtering
   - Provide a global search bar with fuzzy matching for tenants, units, leases
   - Offer faceted filters (status, date, property, rent range) on listing pages
   - Allow users to save custom filter presets

8. Dashboard & At-a-Glance KPIs
   - Show key metrics (vacancy rate, upcoming move-ins, overdue rent) on the home screen
   - Include visual sparklines/trends for rent roll and occupancy
   - Make widgets configurable and draggable

9. Contextual Action Menus
   - Add “Quick Actions” via three-dot menus on list items
   - Support keyboard shortcuts for power-user workflows

10. Responsive & Mobile-First Design
    - Ensure all dashboards work on tablets/phones
    - Implement collapsible side navigation and swipe-friendly controls
    - Use touch-optimized date pickers and modals

11. Notifications & Alerts
    - In-app toast notifications for successes/errors
    - Real-time WebSocket alerts for high-priority events (e.g., new maintenance tickets)
    - Central notification center with read/unread status

12. Accessibility & Internationalization
    - Add ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and high-contrast mode
    - Support Swahili/English language toggle
    - Ensure components are screen-reader friendly

13. Personalization & Onboarding
    - Provide a first-time user tour highlighting key features
    - Create role-based homepages (leasing agent vs. finance officer)
    - Allow user preferences for default views, date formats, and decimals

14. Error Recovery & Help
    - Design descriptive error pages with “Retry” and “Go back” options
    - Include contextual help tooltips and links to documentation
    - Integrate live chat or chatbot for on-demand support
